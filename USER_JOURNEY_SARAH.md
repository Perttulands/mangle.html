# User Journey Research: Sarah, Marketing Manager

## Executive Summary

This document captures the detailed user journey of **Sarah**, a 34-year-old Marketing Manager, as she attempts to use mangle.html to edit an HTML presentation generated by ChatGPT. Sarah represents a critical user persona: **technically curious non-coders** who are increasingly using AI tools to generate HTML but lack the skills to modify it.

### Key Findings

| Category | Score | Assessment |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **First Impression** | 8/10 | Beautiful, modern interface; feels professional |
| **File Upload** | 9/10 | Drag-and-drop is intuitive, very PowerPoint-like |
| **Text Editing** | 4/10 | Requires finding elements; "Text" field hidden in panel |
| **Color Changes** | 3/10 | Color picker exists but requires CSS understanding |
| **Font Size** | 5/10 | Input field exists but "px" units are foreign |
| **Adding Content** | 2/10 | "Insert" menu speaks code, not design |
| **Overall Learnability** | 4/10 | Too many code concepts exposed |

### Critical Insight

> **mangle.html is built for developers who want visual conveniences, not for designers who want to avoid code.**

Sarah will likely abandon the tool within 5 minutes unless she accidentally discovers the right workflow. The terminology, mental model, and feature hierarchy all assume familiarity with HTML/CSS concepts she doesn't have.

## The Persona: Sarah's World

### Who She Is
- **Name:** Sarah Chen, 34
- **Role:** Marketing Manager at a 200-person B2B software company
- **Team:** 4 direct reports, manages content and campaigns
- **Tech Comfort:** High for consumer apps; zero for code

### Her Mental Model
Sarah thinks in terms of tools she knows:

| Sarah's Concept | How She Thinks of It | HTML Reality |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Slide | A page/screen | `<section>` or `<div>` |
| Text box | A container for words | `<div>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`... |
| Fill color | The background | `background-color` CSS property |
| Font size | A dropdown: 12, 14, 18... | `font-size: 16px` |
| Layers | Things in front/behind | z-index, DOM order |
| Copy-paste | Duplicate a text box | Clone element + append to parent |

### Her Software Experience
1. **PowerPoint** - 15 years (her primary mental model)
2. **Canva** - 4 years (secondary model)
3. **Google Docs** - daily use
4. **Figma** - watched a colleague use it once
5. **Code editors** - literally never

### The Backstory

Sarah's boss asked her to create something "more impressive than PowerPoint" for a client pitch. A colleague mentioned "vibe coding" - using ChatGPT to create things without knowing code. Sarah was intrigued.

She prompted ChatGPT:

> "Create me a beautiful HTML presentation about our Q4 marketing results with 5 slides, professional looking, dark theme"

ChatGPT delivered a complete HTML file. Sarah opened it in Chrome - and it looked *amazing*. Dark, sleek, animated transitions. Way better than any PowerPoint template she'd used.

But then reality hit:

1. **The title says "Q4 Marketing Results"** - but should say "Q4 2024 Marketing Results"
2. **A bullet point has a typo** - "increaced" instead of "increased"
3. **The accent color is blue** - but her company brand uses teal (#14B8A6)
4. **One slide's text is too small** - hard to read from the back of a conference room
5. **She needs a 6th slide** - for Q&A

She opened the HTML file in Notepad. Saw this:

```html
<section class="slide" style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e293b 0%, #0f172a 100%); padding: 60px;">
  <h1 style="color: #3b82f6; font-size: 48px; margin-bottom: 24px;">Q4 Marketing Results</h1>
```

Sarah closed Notepad immediately. Her heart rate actually increased. This looked like something that could break.

She googled "edit html file visually" and found mangle.html.

---

## The Journey: Step by Step

### Step 1: First Impression (Loading mangle.html)

#### What Happens
Sarah opens mangle.html in her browser. She sees:

- A dark, polished interface
- A prominent logo with "mangle" branding
- A large drop zone with "Drop your HTML file here"
- A "Try with sample project" button
- Three feature cards: "Direct Selection", "Visual Styling", "DOM Tree"

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Oh, this looks nice. Very... techy but not scary. Like a fancy app, not like code. 'Drop your HTML file here' - okay, that's easy. 'DOM Tree'? What's a DOM? Maybe I don't need to know that part."

#### Emotional State: 7/10 Optimism
She's cautiously hopeful. The interface looks professional enough that she trusts it might work.

#### What Helps
- Clean, modern design builds trust
- Drag-and-drop metaphor is familiar from Canva
- The logo and branding feel like a "real" product

#### What Could Be Better
| Current | Sarah-Friendly Alternative |
|---------|---------------------------|
| "DOM Tree" | "Page Structure" or "All Elements" |
| "Direct Selection" | "Click to Edit" |
| "Visual Styling" | "Colors & Fonts" |
| Keyboard shortcuts shown (⌘Z, ⌘D) | Hide these - they're intimidating to non-coders |

---

### Step 2: Uploading Her File

#### What Happens
Sarah drags her `q4-presentation.html` file onto the drop zone. The interface responds:

1. Drop zone highlights with a purple glow (nice!)
2. File loads into the canvas
3. Her presentation appears in the center panel
4. The left sidebar populates with... a tree of elements
5. A toast notification appears: "File loaded successfully"

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Yes! It worked! There's my presentation! Okay, and on the left... HTML, HEAD, BODY, SECTION, DIV, H1... Oh god, that's the code stuff. But at least I can see my presentation. Maybe I can just click on things?"

#### Emotional State: 8/10 Excitement (peak of journey)
This is the highest point of Sarah's emotional journey. The file loaded, she can see her work, she hasn't had to touch code.

#### What Helps
- Drag and drop works exactly as expected
- Visual preview is instant and accurate
- Toast notification confirms success
- Purple glow on drop zone is delightful

#### What Could Be Better
| Issue | Suggestion |
|-------|------------|
| Element tree shows raw HTML tags | Show friendly names: "Title", "Paragraph", "Section 1" |
| No guidance on what to do next | Add a subtle first-time hint: "Click any element to edit it" |
| Tree uses code icons (⊡, ¶, §) | Use visual icons that represent what things look like |

---

### Step 3: Trying to Change the Title Text

#### The Task
Change "Q4 Marketing Results" to "Q4 2024 Marketing Results"

#### What Sarah Expects (PowerPoint Mental Model)
1. Click on the title text
2. A cursor appears in the text
3. Type to edit directly
4. Done

#### What Actually Happens
1. Sarah moves her mouse over the preview. The cursor is a normal pointer.
2. She clicks on the title. A blue outline appears around it (good!).
3. She starts typing... nothing happens. The presentation doesn't change.
4. She looks around frantically. Where do I type?
5. She notices the right panel now shows "Properties" with fields
6. She sees "Content" section with "Tag: h1" (what does h1 mean?)
7. Below that: "Text" with a text area containing "Q4 Marketing Results"
8. She clicks in that text area and edits it
9. The title updates live! Success!

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Wait, why can't I just type? Oh... I have to use this panel on the right. Okay, 'Tag: h1'... I don't know what that means but I'll ignore it. 'Text' - there it is! Let me edit... YES! It changed! Okay, this is workable. Weird, but workable."

#### Emotional State: 6/10 - Mild Frustration, then Relief

The double-click expectation from PowerPoint/Canva is so ingrained that failing to type directly feels like a bug, not a feature.

#### What Helps
- The properties panel does show the text content
- Live preview updates immediately
- Blue selection highlight confirms which element is selected

#### What Would Make Her Smile
- **Double-click to edit text directly in the canvas**
- Inline text editing like Canva/Figma
- A tooltip on first selection: "Edit text in the panel on the right"

#### What Would Help
| Current Experience | Sarah-Friendly Alternative |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Click selects, panel edits | Double-click enables inline editing |
| "Tag: h1" | "Type: Heading" or just don't show this |
| "Text" label | "Edit text here:" with visual focus on load |
| Text area at default size | Auto-expand text area, make it prominent |

---

### Step 4: Fixing the Typo

#### The Task
Change "increaced" to "increased" in a bullet point

#### What Happens
1. Sarah needs to find the typo. She scans the preview.
2. She spots it on slide 3.
3. She clicks on the paragraph containing the typo.
4. The element tree highlights "P" in the left panel
5. She goes to the properties panel, finds the Text field
6. She sees the full paragraph text, including "increaced"
7. She fixes it. Done!

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Okay, I'm getting the hang of this. Click the thing, edit in the panel. Still wish I could just click and type, but okay."

#### Emotional State: 7/10 - Growing Confidence
She's learning the pattern. It's not intuitive, but it's learnable.

#### What Helps
- Consistency with previous task builds confidence
- Selection works reliably
- Live preview confirms the fix

#### What Could Be Better
- **Find and Replace** - Sarah would love to search for "increaced" instead of visually scanning
- The tree search exists but searches by element type, not content

---

### Step 5: Changing Blue (#3b82f6) to Teal (#14B8A6)

#### The Task
The accent color throughout is blue. Sarah's brand uses teal. She wants to change all the blue to teal.

#### What Sarah Expects (Canva Mental Model)
1. Click on a blue element
2. Click on the blue color to open a color picker
3. Change it to teal
4. Maybe there's a "change all matching colors" option?

#### What Actually Happens

**Attempt 1: Click the title (it's blue)**
1. Sarah clicks the blue title text
2. She looks at the properties panel
3. She sees "Typography" section with "Color" and a color input
4. The color input shows... black (#000000)?!
5. Confused, she changes it to teal anyway
6. Nothing visible changes in the preview

**Why this failed:**
The title's color is set via inline `style="color: #3b82f6"` attribute, but the color picker shows the inherited/computed color as black (default), not the inline style value. The property input doesn't read the actual inline style.

**Attempt 2: Frustration builds**
1. Sarah tries clicking the color picker, choosing teal
2. Still nothing happens
3. She thinks the tool is broken

**Attempt 3: Lucky accident (maybe)**
If Sarah happens to use the browser's color picker (native `<input type="color">`) and selects her teal, and IF the implementation applies it as an inline style, it might work. But the UX failure of not showing the current color is devastating.

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "The color thing shows black but the text is clearly blue. Is this broken? Let me try changing it to teal... nothing happened. Why didn't it change? This is so frustrating. Maybe blue is 'baked in' somehow? In Canva I just click the color and change it. This is impossible."

#### Emotional State: 3/10 - Significant Frustration
This is a low point. Sarah expected the simplest task (change a color) and the tool appears to be broken. She doesn't understand that:
- Colors can be defined in multiple places (inline style, CSS class, inherited)
- The color picker might not be reading the inline style
- She might need to understand CSS specificity

#### What Would Make Her Smile
1. **Color picker pre-fills with the actual current color** (read from computed styles)
2. **"Find & Replace Color"** feature - select blue, replace with teal everywhere
3. **Smart color detection** - "This presentation uses blue (#3b82f6) in 12 places. Change all?"

#### What Would Help
| Current Experience | Sarah-Friendly Alternative |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Color picker shows default | Read and show actual computed color |
| One element at a time | Global color palette with "replace all" |
| No feedback on change | Show "Color changed" toast |
| Raw hex values | Show color swatches with names |

---

### Step 6: Making Text Bigger

#### The Task
The body text on slide 4 is too small. Sarah wants to make it bigger.

#### What Sarah Expects (PowerPoint Mental Model)
1. Select the text
2. Click a font size dropdown (12, 14, 16, 18...)
3. Pick a bigger number
4. Done

#### What Actually Happens
1. Sarah clicks on the small text paragraph
2. She finds "Typography" section in the properties panel
3. She sees "Font Size" with an input field showing... blank? Or "16px"?
4. "px"? What's px? Is that a font size?
5. She tries typing "18" - it becomes "18" (missing px, might not work)
6. Or she types "18px" - this works, text gets bigger
7. But wait, is 18 bigger than 16? In PowerPoint, font sizes are like 10, 12, 14, 24, 36...

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Font Size... okay, but it says '16px'. What's a px? Pixel? I just want it bigger. Let me try 24... okay that's bigger! But wait, is 24px the same as 24pt in PowerPoint? This is confusing. And why isn't there a dropdown? In every other app there's a dropdown."

#### Emotional State: 5/10 - Confusion but Manageable
She can make it work, but the mental translation from "px" to familiar font sizes is an unnecessary cognitive load.

#### What Would Help
| Current Experience | Sarah-Friendly Alternative |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Text input with "px" | Dropdown with common sizes + "Custom" |
| "16px" is cryptic | "Medium (16px)" or just visual sizes |
| No preview of size change | Hover preview: "This will look like: [sample]" |
| Manual input only | Slider + increment buttons (+ / -) |

---

### Step 7: Adding a New Slide (The Breaking Point)

#### The Task
Sarah needs to add a 6th slide for Q&A.

#### What Sarah Expects (PowerPoint Mental Model)
1. Right-click somewhere → "Add Slide"
2. Or click a big "+ Add Slide" button
3. Choose a slide template/layout
4. New slide appears at the end
5. Done

#### What Actually Happens
1. Sarah looks for an "Add Slide" button. There isn't one.
2. She sees "+ Insert" in the toolbar. Clicks it.
3. A dropdown appears with... "Layout", "Text", "Interactive", "Media", "Lists"
4. Under "Layout": div, section, header, footer, nav
5. "div"? "section"? These are code words.
6. She guesses "section" because it sounds like a section of a presentation
7. She clicks "section"
8. A new empty `<section>` appears... but where? At the end? In the middle?
9. It's empty - just a collapsed element in the tree
10. How does she make it look like the other slides?

#### Sarah's Internal Monologue
> "Insert... okay, but where's 'Slide'? These words mean nothing to me. 'div'? 'section'? Is this even the right thing? Let me try section... okay something appeared but I can't even see it. It's just an empty... thing. How do I make it look like my other slides? Do I have to add each thing one by one? This is impossible. I'm going back to PowerPoint."

#### Emotional State: 2/10 - Giving Up
This is the moment Sarah closes the tab and opens PowerPoint. The gap between her mental model and the tool's reality is insurmountable.

#### What Would Make Her Smile
1. **"Duplicate Slide" option** when right-clicking a section/slide
2. **Template library** for common components (Slide, Card, Hero section)
3. **Guided insert**: "What do you want to add?" with visual previews
4. **Copy-paste that duplicates** an entire slide structure

#### What Would Help
| Current Experience | Sarah-Friendly Alternative |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Insert → code element names | Insert → visual categories with previews |
| "section" = empty tag | "Slide" = pre-styled container |
| No templates | "Duplicate this slide" context menu |
| Elements appear invisible | New elements auto-select and highlight |
| Raw code concepts | Visual metaphors: "Page Section", "Text Block", "Image" |

## Pain Points Ranked by Severity

### Critical (Will Cause Abandonment)

1. **No inline text editing** - Double-click should allow typing directly
2. **Color picker doesn't show current color** - Feels broken
3. **Insert menu uses code terminology** - div, section, span mean nothing
4. **No "duplicate slide/section" feature** - Essential for presentations
5. **No template/component library** - Starting from scratch is impossible

### High (Causes Significant Friction)

6. **"DOM Tree" terminology** - Use "Page Elements" or "Structure"
7. **px units required for font size** - Should be a dropdown
8. **No find-and-replace for colors** - "Change all blue to teal"
9. **Element tree shows raw HTML tags** - h1, p, div are meaningless
10. **No first-use guidance** - "Click to select, then edit in panel"

### Medium (Causes Confusion)

11. **Keyboard shortcuts visible by default** - Intimidating to non-coders
12. **"Tag" shown in properties** - Hide technical details by default
13. **No visual indication of inline styles vs CSS** - Just show the current value
14. **Search only searches element types, not content** - Should search text too
15. **Right panel labels like "Typography"** - Use "Text Style" instead

### Low (Minor Annoyances)

16. **No undo specifically for styling changes** - "Reset to original"
17. **Zoom controls are small** - Larger touch targets for less tech-savvy users
18. **Preview mode toggle not obvious** - What's the difference?
19. **Export button says "Export HTML"** - "Save Changes" or "Download" better
20. **Feature cards use technical terms** - Make them action-oriented

---

## Feature Requests from Sarah's Perspective

### "I Wish I Could..."

1. **"Just click and type"** - Inline text editing
2. **"Change all the blues at once"** - Global color palette
3. **"Make a copy of this slide"** - Duplicate with style
4. **"See what things are called"** - Friendly element names
5. **"Pick a font size from a list"** - Dropdown like Word
6. **"Add a new slide like my other ones"** - Template/duplicate
7. **"Search for text to find where it is"** - Full-text search
8. **"Drag things to reorder slides"** - Visual drag-and-drop
9. **"Undo my color change"** - Per-property undo
10. **"Save and open later"** - Browser storage/cloud save

## Recommendations Prioritized by Impact

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

1. **Rename sidebar header from "Elements" to "Page Structure"**
2. **Change "Export HTML" to "Download"**
3. **Show current computed color in color picker** (read from element.style or computed)
4. **Add placeholder text in empty text areas**: "Click here to type..."
5. **Hide keyboard shortcuts by default** (show in a help menu instead)
6. **Change "Tag" label to "Type" in properties panel**

### Tier 2: Important Improvements (High Impact, Medium Effort)

7. **Add "Duplicate" to right-click context menu** (works, but promote it more)
8. **Font size dropdown** with common sizes (12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 32, 48)
9. **Text search** that searches actual text content, not just element types
10. **First-time user tooltip**: "Click elements to select, then edit in the panel"
11. **Friendly names in element tree**: "Title (h1)" instead of just "h1"
12. **Make properties panel show actual inline style values**

### Tier 3: Major Enhancements (High Impact, High Effort)

13. **Inline text editing** - Double-click to edit text directly in canvas
14. **Global color palette** - "Change all #3b82f6 to #14B8A6"
15. **Template library** - Pre-styled "Slide", "Card", "Hero", etc.
16. **Visual insert menu** - Show previews of what each element looks like
17. **Smart duplication** - "Duplicate this section with all its contents"
18. **Guided mode toggle** - "Simple" vs "Advanced" interface

### Tier 4: Future Vision

19. **AI-assisted editing** - "Make the title teal" natural language
20. **Design tokens** - Define brand colors once, apply everywhere
21. **Responsive preview** - Phone/tablet views (already exists, promote it)
22. **Collaboration** - Real-time editing with team
23. **Version history** - "See previous versions"

## What Would Make Sarah Tell Her Colleagues About This Tool

Sarah's word-of-mouth trigger points:

1. **"I clicked the title and just typed"** - Inline editing is the killer feature
2. **"I changed all the colors at once"** - Global find-and-replace for colors
3. **"I added a new slide and it looked just like my others"** - Templates/duplicate
4. **"It was like Canva but for code files"** - The positioning that resonates
5. **"I didn't have to touch any code"** - The promise must be kept

### The One-Sentence Pitch That Would Work for Sarah

> "mangle.html is like Canva for editing HTML files - click anything to change it, no code required."

### The Marketing That Would Resonate

- "Edit ChatGPT's HTML visually"
- "Never touch code again"
- "Click. Type. Done."
- "Your AI made HTML. Now you can edit it."
- "PowerPoint-simple editing for HTML files"

---

## Conclusion: The Core Insight

**mangle.html has all the right capabilities but speaks the wrong language.**

The tool can technically do everything Sarah needs. But every interaction requires her to translate between her mental model (PowerPoint/Canva) and the tool's model (HTML/CSS). That translation effort is exhausting and creates friction at every step.

The fix isn't about adding features - it's about **removing the code from the conversation**.

1. **Hide what Sarah doesn't need to know** - She doesn't need to know it's an h1. She needs to know it's a title.
2. **Show what Sarah expects to see** - The actual color, not the default. A font size dropdown, not a text input.
3. **Work like what Sarah already knows** - Click to select, double-click to edit, right-click for options.

If mangle.html can bridge this gap, it becomes the essential tool for the "vibe coding" era - where AI generates the code and humans perfect the result without ever seeing a single bracket.

---

## Appendix: Sarah's Ideal User Flow

### The Dream Scenario

1. Sarah drags in her HTML file
2. A friendly message says "Click anything to edit it"
3. She double-clicks the title → cursor appears → she types directly
4. She notices a blue element, clicks it → sees "Color: Blue (#3b82f6)" in the panel
5. She clicks the color → picker opens → she chooses teal → all blues become teal? (option presented)
6. She wants bigger text → clicks → sees "Size: Medium ▼" → picks "Large"
7. She wants a new slide → right-clicks → "Add Section Like This" → new slide appears
8. She clicks "Download" → gets her updated file
9. She texts her colleague: "OMG you have to try this tool"

That's the goal.
